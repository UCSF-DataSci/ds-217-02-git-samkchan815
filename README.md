## Why DATASCI 217?
To be honest, I am in this class because it is required for my program. I have prior experience with Python, but I am really looking forward to learning more about using the command line using WSL and PowerShell. In previous classes, I was taught how to use Linux/Unix, but with a virtual machine, which is very time consuming to set up and has a lot of problems. I think it will be very valuable to learn how to run scripts using WSL and PowerShell because they use fewer resources and are more integrated into the Windows environment. I also hope to brush up on the basics of Python in case there are some things I have forgotten over time.

## Assignment 1
